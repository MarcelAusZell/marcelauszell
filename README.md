## Hi there 👋, my name is Marcel Sayegh  
I'm from Germany and currently a Computer Science master's student at RWTH Aachen University.  
My interests lie in Visual Computing, Machine Learning, and (interactive) visualizations (often in combination with one another).

## Visit some of my projects  
#### 🌆 [City Pathfinding Visualizer](https://marcelauszell.github.io/city-pathfinding/)  
Interactive pathfinding algorithms in a city map environment.

#### ✍️ [MNIST Projects](https://marcelauszell.github.io/mnist-projects/)  
Handwriting recognition demos built with neural networks.

#### 🧠 [Scrollytelling ML (RWTH Medialab)](https://scrollytelling-ml-medialab-e2608723069b047745ff21c2aab2b0bdc3f6.pages.rwth-aachen.de/)
